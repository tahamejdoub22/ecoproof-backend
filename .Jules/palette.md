**Learning:** For backend applications, API documentation (like Swagger) IS the user interface. Features like 'filter' and 'docExpansion: none' significantly improve the "User Experience" for developers consuming the API, reducing cognitive load and time-to-value.
**Action:** Always check Swagger/OpenAPI configuration in backend projects for opportunities to declutter and simplify the developer interface.
